				"steps": [
					"1. Place the egg whites in a bowl.",
					"2. Add the sugar into the egg whites.",
					"3. Use a hand mixer or a stand mixer to beat the egg whites and sugar together. (Start slow to melt the sugar, then use the middle speed to whip until the larger bubbles disappear. Finally, use the fastest speed until the egg whites reach stiff peaks.",
					"4. Sift in half of the almond flour and powdered sugar.",
					"5. Use the slowest speed on the mixer to incorporate everything before sifting in the remaining half of almond flour and powdered sugar.",
					"6. Continue to mix until there is a slow ribbon that forms when the whisk is lifted.",
					"7. Transfer the mixture to a piping bag with a circular tip.",
					"8. Pipe the macarons onto a piece of parchment paper on a baking tray (Print out a macaron template online for consistent macaron shells).",
					"9. Drop the tray from a few inches off the ground or counter to get rid of any air bubbles in the macarons. Repeat several times. (If there are still air bubbles, use a toothpick to gently remove them.)",
					"10. Let the macarons rest for about an hour. (This waiting period depends on the humidity in your area.) The macarons will be ready when the tops become matte. Lightly run a finger over the tops and if the macarons are dry, they're ready to be put in the oven.",
					"11. Preheat the oven to 120 °C (250 °F)",
					"12. Lower the heat to 90 °C (195 °F) and place the macarons in the oven for 2-3 minutes. Leave the oven door slightly open for a little more drying.",
					"13. Close the oven door and set the heat to 140 °C (285 °F).",
					"14. Bake the macarons for 15 minutes.",
					"15. Let the macarons cool on a wire rack."

					"3. While it's heating up, start whisking the egg whites to a fluffy state.",
					"4. Once the egg whites are fluffy and the syrup is heated, slowly pour the syrup into the egg whites while the egg whites continue to be whisked.",
					"5. Continue to whisk until the mixture cools down to 20°C - 25°C (68°F - 72°F).",
					"6. Once cooled, add in unsalted butter little by little. (If it gets clumpy or watery, just continue mixing--it will fix itself! The final mixture should be soft and fluffy but creamy and smooth.",
					"7. Mix in lingonberry jam (and food coloring if desired)."
