			"4. Sift in half of the almond flour and powdered sugar.",
			"5. Use the slowest speed on the mixer to incorporate everything before sifting in the remaining half of almond flour and powdered sugar.",
			"6. Continue to mix until there is a slow ribbon that forms when the whisk is lifted.",
			"7. Transfer the mixture to a piping bag with a circular tip.",
			"8. Pipe the macarons onto a piece of parchment paper on a baking tray (Print out a macaron template online for consistent macaron shells).",
			"9. Drop the tray from a few inches off the ground or counter to get rid of any air bubbles in the macarons. Repeat several times. (If there are still air bubbles, use a toothpick to gently remove them.)",
			"10. Let the macarons rest for about an hour. (This waiting period depends on the humidity in your area.) The macarons will be ready when the tops become matte. Lightly run a finger over the tops and if the macarons are dry, they're ready to be put in the oven.",
			"11. Preheat the oven to 120 °C (250 °F)",
			"12. Lower the heat to 90 °C (195 °F) and place the macarons in the oven for 2-3 minutes. Leave the oven door slightly open for a little more drying.",
